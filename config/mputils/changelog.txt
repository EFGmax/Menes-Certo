									§4 3.0.6 Changelog										
* §6Reborn Storage has been updated to fix the huge performance decrease when connecting the multiblock crafting structure to your Refined Storage system
* Chickens now actually drop gold ingots correctly as opposed to only on death
* §6In an effort to increase performance, Colossal Chests developers has rewritten a significant portion of the mod to institute a new inventory system to better integrate with other mods. Many have reported the mod is "too buggy" when in fact much of this is due to how other mods integrate with colossal chests, for example, Actually Additions laser relays or translocators trying to access every single inventory slot at the exact same time. This can be quite cumbersome for your server. This has been redone and should have a much better integration with other mods. This will still require many mods to update their code to reflect the new inventory handling system. Integrated Dynamics is the only mod that has made this change so far, meaning you should notice significantly less lag when connecting the two mods. Refined Storage is in the middle of this addition, too. You should see this completed for the 3.0.7 SkyFactory update
* Removed the iChisel recipe. It was already removed from JEI, but users kept reporting a crash after crafting and using it. This is a known crash and has no fix at the moment

* The update to Simple Labels SHOULD stop chunks from NBT corruption. What this means is your refined storage importer/exporters/etc. should not spin around and your Vast Storage Units SHOULD not delete their contents any longer. Big emphasis on SHOULD!
* §6Long Fall Boots no longer require a Nether Star
* Wood Chips should now drop 100% for every user. There was an issue where many users reported Wood Chips not dropping any longer or compostable. I've added Wood Chippings to both the Hammer and Composting registries so every user should now get them

* Prismarine Blocks can now be crushed/pulverized/etc. into Prismarine Shards

* §6Unified and made sure all crushing/pulverizing/etc. created the same type of dust instead of different machines creating different modded dusts.

The reasoning for making this switch was to simplify the process and Immersive Engineering Grit has more uses and is more beneficial to the player
* Bauxite aka Aluminum should now generate in the Beneath
* §6Regenerated the Common Capabilities, Chickens, More Chickens, Open Computers, and a few other configuration files to eliminate console message spam and eliminate issues
* Added the Tinkers' Stone Torch and the Menril Torch to the Crucible Melting item list

* For all servers: Your island.json in the config server for the folder needs to remain after this update or else all players will have their spawns overwritten.
