Welcome To Sky Factory 3!|A Modpack By Bacon_Donut|=======================::1
Hello and welcome to Sky Factory 3, a Sky Block mod pack! An infinite world of possibility awaits you. You'll be starting in a void world with nothing between you and death but a single tree on one piece of dirt. But don't panic! The mods in this pack will allow you to get all the resources you need to build yourself an amazing world! Read on for more info about how to play this pack, who put it together, and for a list of goals for you to achieve!::1
 |How To Use This Book|===================::1
Use the arrows at the bottom of the pages to navigate the book. You will see challenges separated into ages that represent the general path of progression, although you do not need to do them in order. Simply check the box next to each challenge on completion. Careful though, quests become increasingly difficult as you progress! Also, don't forget to craft yourself an Achievement Stand to store this book on!| | | |::1
A Note About Biomes|==============::1
The challenges in this book will help you through the early game, but there are several commonly asked question regarding biome behavior in Sky Factory.::1
You can obtain water by using a barrel to catch rain or snow. If you happen to spawn in a desert where it does not rain you can craft a water bucket. You may also craft Wooden Crucibles to collect water if needed. Look it up in NEI to learn more.::1
Ocean and Mushroom biomes are both viable locations to spawn in, passive animals will spawn in them. If animals are not spawning, use Bait to lure them into your base.::1
|Also, if you're the kind of person who likes to train dragons, remember that what biome you hatch your dragon in will determine what kind of dragon it grows up to be!::1
